My book scan repo for use with gphoto2

Connect the cameras. Unmount them. Run gphoto2 --auto-detect to get the port names

cd to the root of the repo then run the automatic photo taker and image rotator like this:

"capture [left/right] [port name] [starting page number] [interval between loops]

e.g. capture right usb:001,005 1 1
